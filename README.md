A game of matching GIFs.

Gifmatch is a pairs-matching game with a twist: match animated gifs, not just static images.

I've liked playing video games since I was a kid, so I wanted to make my own game. Gifmatch is a memory matching game. The objective is to match all the pairs of Gifs on the grid in as short a time as possible.

I used the tenor gif API to populate the grid randomly based on user search parameters. The grid gets different gifs in different arrangements every time you play.

You can also select easy, medium, or hard to have a smaller or larger grid.

To write this app I used Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Materialize.

Enjoy!
